1. Introduction                                             *gitv-introduction*

|gitv| is a 'gitk clone' plugin for the text editor Vim. The goal is to give
you a similar set of functionality as a repository viewer. Using this plugin
you can view a repository's history including branching and merging, you can
see which commits refs point to. You can quickly and easily view what changed
to which files and when. You can perform arbitrary diffs (using Vim's
excellent built in diff functionality) and you can easily check out whole
commits and branches or just individual files if need be.

Throw in the fact that it is running in Vim and you get for free: the ability
to move over repository history quickly and precisely using Vim's built in
movement operators. You get excellent code syntax highlighting due to Vim's
built in ability. You can open up all sorts of repository views in multiple
windows and position them exactly how you like. You can take advantage of
Vim's registers to copy multiple fragments of code from previous commits. The
list goes on.

This plugin is an extension of the |fugitive| plugin.

I hope you like it!

2. Installation                                             *gitv-installation*

Install in ~/.vim, or in ~\vimfiles if you're on Windows. This plugin should
be fully pathogen compatible if you want to install it this way.

|gitv| was developed against Vim 7.3 but earlier versions of Vim should work.
Vim 7.2+ is recommended as it ships with syntax highlighting for many Git file
types. You will also need the |fugitive| plugin installed and working for
|gitv| to work.

==============================================================================
3. Usage                                                           *gitv-usage*

|gitv| defines the following command.

:[range]Gitv[!] [args]

                  Invoking this command on a buffer that belongs to a git
                  repository causes the gitv browser to open. '!' causes gitv
                  to open in file mode rather than browser mode. Any [args]
                  supplied are passed on to the gitv viewer and can be used to
                  narrow the commits that are shown. If this command is run
                  on a buffer not belonging to a git repository a message
                  stating 'Not a git repository.' is displayed.

                  When used with a [range] this has no effect in browser mode.
                  In file mode it narrows the commits shown to only those
                  affecting lines in the range. See section 3.8 for more
                  details.

The following abbreviation is also defined so that you can type :gitv without
capitalisation. The abbreviation is defined in such a way that this
substitution is only performed when 'gitv' is the first word on the command
line.
>
    cabbrev gitv Gitv

3.1 Browser mode

|gitv| has two distinct modes. Browser mode and file mode. The browser mode is
opened in a new tab and allows the repository history to be viewed for all
files. This is activated by running :Gitv without a '!'.

In this mode you can view the entire repository history and see which files
were changed with each commit. This mode tries to closely resemble gitk.

3.2 File mode

File mode is opened in a |preview-window| above the buffer you are currently in.
This view is tailored to act on the buffer that :Gitv! was run from, the
"focused" file. Whilst in this mode all actions performed are specific to the
single focused file. The browser only shows commits where the focused file
changed.  Selecting a commit, views the focused file as it was in that commit.
Performing a check out only checks the focused file out as it was in the
commit. And so on. See 3.4 for the differences.

3.3 Arguments

You can pass arguments to the :Gitv command. These allow you to filter and
narrow the commits shown. Essentially, gitv is a glorified 'git log' wrapper
and so any flag that 'git log' accepts so will gitv. gitv does not inspect the
arguments passed on to 'git log' and so may not work if they don't make sense.

Without any arguments gitv behaves just like gitk and git log without
arguments. It will display the commit history for the currently checked out
branch.

Gitv will also accept and autocomplete filenames. Only filenames at the end of
the command are supported, as in 'git log'.

Here are some particularly useful examples of arguments that could be
passed to :Gitv. For more info see 'git help log' and in particular the
section: "Commit Limiting".

    Flag              Description ~

    --all             View repository history for all refs.

    --bisect          If a bisect is started, show only the remaining commits.

    <since>..<until>  Show only commits between the named two commits. When
                      either <since> or <until> is omitted, it defaults to
                      HEAD, i.e. the tip of the current branch. For a more
                      complete list of ways to spell <since> and <until>,
                      see gitrevisions(7).

    --merges          View only merge commits.

    -S<string>        Look for differences that introduce or remove an
                      instance of <string>. Note that this is different than
                      the string simply appearing in diff output; see the
                      pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore(7) for more details.

    -G<regex>         Look for differences whose added or removed line
                      matches the given <regex>.

3.4 Key mappings.                                     *gitv-browser-mappings*

This is a list of key mappings that will work only in the gitv browser window.
Where appropriate the differences in action is described for the two gitv
modes.

    Mode        Map     Description~

    normal      <cr>      Opens a commit. In browser mode this will show the
                          commit header information including the commit
                          message. It will also display a full diff showing all the
                          changes to files.

                          Tip: if you press <cr> on anything sensible you can
                          view the expected output. For example pressing <cr> on
                          the line beginning a file diff, it will display the
                          diff using Vim's built in diff viewing capability.
                          Pressing <cr> on the tree sha will list all the files
                          in the commit and pressing <cr> on one of these will
                          show that file as it was in the commit. And so on.

                          Pressing <cr> on the line "-- Load More --" will load
                          |g:Gitv_CommitStep| more commits.

                          In file mode this will open the focused file as it was
                          in the currently selected diff. This allows you to
                          easily go back in time and look at the focused file.

                          Pressing <cr> on the top line in file mode opens the
                          current working copy of the focused file.

    normal      <c-n>     In either browser or file mode, this moves down to
                J         the next commit and opens it. This allows you to
                          quickly move from commit to commit and view either
                          the commit details or the file itself, depending on
                          the mode, in one action.

    normal      <c-p>     The same as <c-n> but move back a commit.
                K

    normal      o         The same as <cr> but opens in a new |split|.
                <c-j>

    normal      O         The same as <cr> but opens in a new |tab|.
                <c-l>

    normal      s         The same as <cr> but opens in a new |vsplit|.
                <c-k>

    normal      gw         Switch between the preview window and browser.

    normal      i         This performs the same thing as <cr> in browser mode.
                <c-cr>    In file mode it opens the commit details rather than
                          the focused file. (NOTE: many terminal emulators do
                          not support <c-cr>).

    normal      q         Quits gitv. In browser mode this will close the entire
                          tab. In file mode this closes only the |preview-window|.
                          Note: in browser mode this will close the tab
                          regardless of any windows you may have opened as well
                          as the gitv windows.

    normal      a         Switches the '--all' argument and updates the browser
                          window.

    normal      u         Forces an update of the content of the browser window.

    normal      co        Performs a 'git checkout' of the commit the cursor is
                          on. In both modes this will present you with a choice
                          of whether you would like to checkout the sha or any
                          ref that might point to this commit.

                          File mode differs in that it doesn't check out the
                          entire commit but just the focused file in that
                          commit.

                          Tip: in gVim this will present you with a pop up dialog.
                          You can make this a text choice by performing ':set
                          guioptions+=c.'

    normal      D         Performs a diff using Vim's built in diff viewing
                          capabilities. This does nothing in browser mode. In
                          file mode it will diff the current file with the
                          focused file in the commit under the cursor.

    visual      D         In visual mode this performs a diff against the file
                          in the commit at the top of the selection against the
                          file in the commit at the bottom of the selection. The
                          newest file is always on the right.

    normal      S         Open a diffstat of everything that has changed since
                          the commit under the cursor, in both browse and
                          normal mode.

    visual      S         In visual mode this works in exactly the same way as
                          normal mode. However, it only shows what has changed
                          in the range of commits that are highlighted.

    visual      m         Merges the commit in either the top or bottom line of
                          the selection into the commit specified by the other
                          end of the selection. This uses prompts to guide you
                          through the merge process and should be fairly
                          intuitive. By default, it will also ask for
                          confirmation if you wish to perform a fast-forward
                          merge or not. If you have defined g:Gitv_MergeArgs,
                          you will not be prompted to fast forward.

                          gitv does not allow you to merge arbitrary commits.
                          The lines at the top and bottom of the selection
                          must contain refs in the form of tags, remotes or
                          local branches.

    visual      cp        Cherry-Picks the selected commits to the active
                          branch.

    normal      cp        Same as visual cp

    visual      rb        Reset (mixed) the active branch to the top of the
                          selected commits.

    normal      rb        Same as visual rb

    visual      rbs       Reset (soft) the active branch to the top of the
                          selected commits.

    normal      rbs       Same as visual rbs

    visual      rbh       Reset (hard) the active branch to the top of the
                          selected commits.

    normal      rbh       Same as visual rbh

    normal      rev       Revert the commit. If the commit is a merge, selects
                          the first parent for reverting to.

    visual      rev       Same as rev, but revert a range of commits. If a
                          merge is within the range, fails by necessity.

    visual      d         Delete a branch or tag on the selected line. You will
                          be asked which branch/tag to use.

    normal      d         Same as visual d

    normal      <leader>m Merges the first ref found on the current line in to
                          the branch currently pointed to by HEAD. By default,
                          this will prompt you if you wish to use a fast-forward
                          merge. If you have defined g:Gitv_MergeArgs, you
                          will not be prompted to fast forward.

    normal      git       Enters command mode with ":Git " already typed for
                          you. Just a convenient shortcut for executing git
                          commands and watching them affect the repository.

    normal      yc        Copy the sha on the current line in either mode.
                          This also copies it to the '+' register so that it
                          can be pasted externally. If there is no commit on
                          the current line the behaviour (although harmless)
                          is undefined.

Here is a list of extra key mappings that can be used to efficiently move
around a repository history in the browser window.

    Mode        Map     Description~

    normal      x       Jumps the cursor forward to the next branching point
                        in the history.

    normal      X       Jumps the cursor backward to the previous branching
                        point in the history.

    normal      r       Jumps the cursor forward to the next ref in the
                        history.

    normal      R       Jumps the cursor backward to the previous ref in the
                        history.

    normal      P       Jumps the cursor to the commit referenced by HEAD.

    normal      p       Jumps the cursor to the commit which is the parent of
                        current line.  When on a merge commit, a |count|
                        may be used to choose a parent other than the first.

Here is a list of mapping for rebasing.

    Mode        Map     Description~

    normal      grr     Rebase the current HEAD onto the ref or commit under
                        the cursor. A choice will be given of multiple refs.

    normal      grR     Mark the commit under the line for reword.

    normal      grE     Mark the commit under the line for edit.

    normal      grS     Mark the commit under the line for squash.

    normal      grF     Mark the commit under the line for fixup.

    normal      grX     Mark the commit under the line for exec. A command must
                        be entered to be executed. The command will be
                        executed after performing an instruction on the
                        commit. By default, the commit will be picked.

    normal      grD     Mark the commit under the line for dropping.

    normal      grP     Mark the commit under the line for picking. Since this
                        is the default instruction, if every commit is marked
                        for picking, no commits will be considered marked.
                        This also removes exec commands from marking commits
                        with grX.

    normal      grs     Start or stop (disable) an interactive rebase.
                        Interactive rebasing is only available in browser mode.
                        Merge commits are preserved.
                        If the rebase has already been started, merely enables
                        rebase mode.
                        If starting the rebase without instructions, it begins
                        at the commit before the commit under the cursor in
                        edit mode. This is a limitation of interactive
                        rebasing.
                        If any commits have been marked for an instruction,
                        automatically runs the interactive rebase.
                        If enabled in browser mode with files specified, will
                        drop the file names while the rebase is in progress.

    normal      gra     Abort the current rebase.

    normal      grn     Go to the next commit in the current rebase (skip).
                        Accepts a count.

    normal      grc     Continue through the rebase until input is needed.

    visual      grR,    Same as normal mode, but marks every commit.
                grE,
                grS,
                grF,
                grX,
                grD,
                grP

    visual      grs,    Same as normal mode, but will attempt to rebase from
                grr     a ref at the top or bottom to the other end of the
                        selection.

Here is a list of mappings for bisecting.

    Mode        Map     Description~

    normal      gbs     Begin the bisecting process. If the bisecting process
                        has been started elsewhere, merely enables bisect mode.
                        If the bisecting process has already been enabled,
                        disables bisecting mode.
                        Works in both modes.
                        If file names have been specified, only bisects the
                        selected files.
                        Mnemonic- git bisect start/git bisect stop.

    visual      gbs     Same as normal mode, but if the bisecting process has
                        not yet been started, marks the first commit selected
                        as bad and the last commit selected as good.

    normal      gbg     Mark the commit under the cursor as good.

    visual      gbg     Mark selected commits as good.

    normal      gbb     Mark the commit under the cursor as bad.

    visual      gbb     Mark selected commits as bad.

    normal      gbn     Skip the commit under the cursor. Accepts a count. If
                        a count is given, ignores the commit under the cursor
                        and starts at the currently checked out commit.
                        Mnemonic- git bisect next.

    normal      gbr     End the bisect process. Mnemonic- git bisect reset.

    normal      gbl     Save the current bisect history to a file. Edit the log
                        file to correct mistakes and replay later.
                        Mnemonic- git bisect log.

    normal      gbp     Replay a saved log file.

3.5 Commands

Running the |:Git| command in the commit browser window, in either mode, will
cause the |:Git| command to be run as expected but the commit history will
automatically update to reflect any changes too.

3.6 Windows

In browser mode, two windows are opened initially. The "browser window" that
displays the commit history and the "preview window" that shows the currently
selected commit.

In file mode, a |preview-window| is opened above the current file. This is a
browser window filtered to show commits only affecting the focused file. The
window holding the focused file acts as the preview window in this mode.

NOTE: In both modes the buffer in the preview window is wiped after replacing
it.  This is to stop the quick build up of fugitive buffers. A buffer will not
be wiped if it contains unsaved changes. Buffers are not wiped when opening a
commit in a split, vsplit or a new tab.

When opening a commit, the window it will be opened in is determined by simple
rules. If in browser mode and the layout is vertical it will open in the
window to the immediate right (exactly as if you performed <c-w>l). If in a
horizontal layout, it will be opened in the window immediately below (exactly
as if you performed <c-w>j). If in file mode, it will open exactly like
browser mode split horizontally. NOTE: It is for this reason that you should
not move the browser window as it will cause commits to be opened in
unexpected places.

3.7 Folding

Folding of branches is supported in the browser window. Initially all folds
are always open and will open on a reload. You can collapse any branch by
using Vim's built in fold operators. See |folding| for more details.

3.8 Using with a range of lines

If a range is passed to the :Gitv command it will have no effect in browser
mode. In file mode however, only commits that affect at least one line in the
range will be displayed. This is useful, for example, to view the commit
history for a function and all of the changes made to it.

If a range of less than two lines is used then gitv opens in regular file
mode.

Selecting a commit by pressing <cr> on it will show the file as it was in that
commit with all lines not in the range folded away. This allows you to quickly
and easily move from commit to commit viewing the evolution of the range of
lines. Pressing <c-cr> will show you the commit details so that you can see
any other changes it may have made. (NOTE: many terminal emulators do not
support <c-cr>).

The range that Git looks at is specified by the first and last line in the
range passed to :Gitv. These lines are escaped appropriately and passed to Git
to use as a regular expression. If you wish to modify either regex delimiter
this can be done by pressing <cr> on the appropriate line near the top of the
file mode buffer. Vim will prompt you to modify the regex. If you press enter
without modification, nothing happens. If you modify the regex (Git supports
POSIX regular expressions) gitv will automatically update.

You may also pass arguments to the :Gitv! command when using a range. This
filters the commits that are to be compared for changes in the range. For
example you could pass the name of a branch to only look at changes in commits
on that branch.

Note: This feature requires the bash shell to be installed on your system and
in your path. This should already be the case for the majority of users.

Note: Using a range searches back through the commit history looking at each
section of lines for where changes occurred. It will only look at the last
g:Gitv_CommitStep number, if you don't get any matches you could try pressing
<cr> on the 'load more' line. This command may be slow if you choose a large
range and have a large g:Gitv_CommitStep.

==============================================================================
4. Configuration Options                               *gitv-config-options*

You can set the following options in your .vimrc to override the values used
by |gitv|. The defaults are shown.

4.1 Commit Step

This is the number of commits to show each time. When pressing <cr> on
"-- Load More --", the number of extra commits loaded is g:Gitv_CommitStep.
The default is a screen's worth of lines. This should be set to an integer
number. Setting this to a value _really_ high will load the entire repo in one
go.
>
    g:Gitv_CommitStep = &lines
<

4.2 Open Horizontal

This is the default layout to use in browser mode. If set to 0 then browser
mode will open in a vertical split. If set to 1 then browser mode will open in
a horizontal split. If set to 'auto' then browser mode will open in a vertical
split unless the content fits better in a horizontal split, in which case it
will open horizontally.

The commit browser width and height is automatically sized to best fit the
content in all modes and settings.
>
    g:Gitv_OpenHorizontal = 0
<

4.3 Git Executable

Gitv uses the same executable as fugitive.

4.4 Wipe All on Close

This option should be set to either 0 (to disable) or 1 (to enable). If set to
1 then on closing the browser mode by using the q key all buffers displayed in
a window in the tab will be wiped before the tab is closed. This option allows
you to limit the number of fugitive buffers that accumulate in the use of gitv.

NOTE: This will not wipe any buffer with unsaved content. It will however
mercilessly wipe all buffers in the tab regardless of the file they hold.
>
    g:Gitv_WipeAllOnClose = 0
<

4.5 Wrap Lines

If set to 1 then line wrapping is enabled. This is useful if you have
occasional very long commit messages.
>
    g:Gitv_WrapLines = 0
<

4.6 Truncate Commit Subjects

If set to 1 then commit subject truncation is enabled. This will truncate
commit subjects, where necessary, so that the whole line will fit in one
screen width. If this is set, then automatically switching to a horizontal
layout will no longer work as commits will be truncated to always fit in a
vertical split. NOTE: It is possible that this can truncate any refs pointing
at a commit. In this situation it will not be possible to check out any of
these refs. This is due to gitv being unable to recognise that they are refs.
>
    g:Gitv_TruncateCommitSubjects = 0
<

4.7 Open Preview On Launch

If set to 1 then the preview window is displayed when launching gitv in
browser mode. If set to 0 then no preview window is displayed until a commit
is opened. This option has no effect in file mode.
>
    g:Gitv_OpenPreviewOnLaunch = 1
<

4.8 Prompt to Delete Merge Branch

If set to 1 then, when performing a merge using gitv, you will be prompted if
you wish to delete the topic branch. If you often merge a branch into another
and rarely wish to delete branches, set this to 0. The default is 0.
>
    let g:Gitv_PromptToDeleteMergeBranch = 0
<
4.9 Custom merge arguments

The purpose of this option is to customize the merging behaviour. To use the
default merge behaviour, unset this variable. To not confirm for fast forward,
set this to an empty string. By default, this is undefined.
>
    unset! g:Gitv_MergeArgs
<

Example: if you wish to use a different merge strategy, you can use this.
>
    fu! MergeOurs()
      let g:Gitv_MergeArgs = '--strategy=ours'
      " Escape put in because of :normal quirks with space
      execute "normal \<Esc> m"
      " Put whatever your default is here
      unlet! g:Gitv_MergeArgs
    enfu
    autocmd FileType gitv nno Mo :<C-U>call MergeOurs()<C-M>
<
4.10 Do not map the control key

If this is set then no mappings that use the control key will be created. The
control key mappings are all alternatives and so can be disabled without
losing functionality. The default is to create the mappings.
>
    let g:Gitv_DoNotMapCtrlKey = 1
>

4.11 Do not log bisect actions

If this is set then no bisect mappings will log their actions. This will
prevent the need to press enter after every bisect action, but could cause
confusion. Errors will still be shown.
>
    let g:Gitv_QuietBisect = 1

4.12 Custom key mappings                       *gitv-custom-browser-mappings*

Set custom key mappings which will overwrite the defaults. The following would
result in bindings equivalent to the defaults.

6.1 Tips and tricks

I use the following mappings to make working with |gitv| easier.
>
    nmap <leader>gv :Gitv --all<cr>
    nmap <leader>gV :Gitv! --all<cr>
    vmap <leader>gV :Gitv! --all<cr>
<
The vmap equivalent for file mode is to make dealing with ranges easier. It
allows you to visually select a range of lines to view the commit history for
that section of the file.

The following abbreviation makes running arbitrary git commands much easier.
>
    cabbrev git Git
<

The function: 'Gitv_OpenGitCommand(command, windowCmd)' is provided to allow
the more advanced user to create their own commands. This function will
execute the git command provided in the new window created using windowCmd.

By using this function you get for free: the buffer set up for read only git
output, including syntax highlighting and many other tailored options. You
also get mappings for 'u' to update the output and 'q' to easily close the
window.

Here is an example of getting diff output both cached and not, in a vertical
and horizontal split respectively.
>
    call Gitv_OpenGitCommand("diff --no-color --cached", 'vnew')
    call Gitv_OpenGitCommand("diff --no-color", 'new')
<

I like my diff colors to be green for added lines and red for removed lines,
just like in the shell. Adding this to your vimrc will accomplish this.
>
    highlight diffAdded guifg=#00bf00
    highlight diffRemoved guifg=#bf0000
<

I highly recommend adding to your vimrc:
>
    set lazyredraw
<

This stops Vim from redrawing the screen during complex operations and results
in much smoother looking plugins.

6.2 API

You can grab the current line's hash programatically with
>
    gitv#util#line#sha(line('.'))
<
You can grab the ref with
>
    gitv#util#line#refs('.')
<
